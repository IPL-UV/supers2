It facilitates downloading (cubo package), preparing, and processing the Sentinel-2 data and applies deep learning models to enhance the spatial resolution of the imagery. Installation \u2699\ufe0f Install the latest version from PyPI: pip install cubo supers2 How to use \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Basic usage: enhancing spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 images \ud83c\udf0d Load libraries import cubo import supers2 import torch import numpy as np Download Sentinel-2 L2A cube # Create a Sentinel-2 L2A data cube for a specific location and date range da = cubo . create ( lat = 4.31 , lon =- 76.2 , collection = \"sentinel-2-l2a\" , bands = [ \"B02\" , \"B03\" , \"B04\" , \"B05\" , \"B06\" , \"B07\" , \"B08\" , \"B8A\" , \"B11\" , \"B12\" ], start_date = \"2021-06-01\" , end_date = \"2021-10-10\" , edge_size = 128 , resolution = 10 ) Prepare the data (CPU and GPU usage) When converting the NumPy array to a PyTorch tensor, the use of cuda() is optional and depends on whether the user has access to a GPU. Below is the explanation for both cases: GPU: If a GPU is available and CUDA is installed, you can transfer the tensor to the GPU using .cuda() . This improves the processing speed, especially for large datasets or deep learning models. CPU: If no GPU is available, the tensor will be processed on the CPU, which is the default behavior in PyTorch. In this case, simply omit the .cuda() call. Here\u2019s how you can handle both scenarios dynamically: # Convert the data array to NumPy and scale original_s2_numpy = ( da [ 11 ] . compute () . to_numpy () / 10_000 ) . astype ( \"float32\" ) # Check if CUDA is available, use GPU if possible, otherwise fallback to CPU device = torch . device ( \"cuda\" if torch . cuda . is_available () else \"cpu\" ) # Create the tensor and move it to the appropriate device (CPU or GPU) X = torch . from_numpy ( original_s2_numpy ) . float () . to ( device ) Define the resolution enhancement model # Set up the model to enhance the spatial resolution models = supers2 . setmodel ( SR_model_loss = \"l1\" , SR_model_name = \"cnn\" , SR_model_size = \"small\" , Fusionx2_model_size = \"lightweight\" , Fusionx4_model_size = \"lightweight\" ) Apply spatial resolution enhancement # Apply the model to enhance the image resolution to 2.5 meters superX = supers2 . predict ( X , models = models , resolution = \"2.5m\" ) Visualize the results \ud83c\udfa8 Display images import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Plot the original and enhanced-resolution images fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , 2 , figsize = ( 10 , 5 )) ax [ 0 ] . imshow ( X [[ 2 , 1 , 0 ]] . permute ( 1 , 2 , 0 ) . cpu () . numpy () * 4 ) ax [ 0 ] . set_title ( \"Original S2\" ) ax [ 1 ] . imshow ( superX [[ 2 , 1 , 0 ]] . permute ( 1 , 2 , 0 ) . cpu () . numpy () * 4 ) ax [ 1 ] . set_title ( \"Enhanced Resolution S2\" ) plt . show () Supported features and filters \u2728 Enhance spatial resolution to 2.5 meters: Use advanced CNN models to enhance Sentinel-2 imagery.
